# BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (BRD)

## TeleCare Connect

## 1. Introduction

The TeleCare Connect project aims to develop a secure, HIPAA-compliant telemedicine platform that integrates real-time vital-sign data from patients' home devices such as blood pressure cuffs and pulse oximeters. This platform will enable clinicians to set custom alerts, triage based on incoming data trends, and seamlessly escalate to in-person care when needed. The project is set to commence on June 1, 2025, and conclude by December 31, 2026.

## 2. Business Objectives

- Develop a HIPAA-compliant telemedicine platform to ensure patient data security.
- Integrate real-time vital-sign data from home devices to enhance patient monitoring.
- Enable clinicians to set custom alerts and triage based on data trends for proactive care management.
- Facilitate seamless escalation to in-person care when necessary to improve patient outcomes.

## 3. Project Scope

### 3.1 In Scope

- Development of a secure, HIPAA-compliant telemedicine platform.
- Integration with various home medical devices for real-time vital-sign data collection.
- Custom alert system for clinicians based on patient data trends.
- Triage functionality for clinicians to manage patient care proactively.
- Seamless escalation process from telemedicine to in-person care.

### 3.2 Out of Scope

- Direct integration with electronic health record (EHR) systems.
- Support for non-medical home devices.
- Features beyond telemedicine, such as billing and insurance management.

- The platform should provide clear instructions and help resources for users.

### 5.4 Reliability

- The system should have an uptime of at least 99.9%.
- Regular backups should be performed to ensure data integrity and availability.

## 6. Project Constraints

### 6.1 Budget

The total budget for the project is $5,000,000, with contingencies for unforeseen costs.

### 6.2 Timeline

The project must be completed within the timeline of June 1, 2025, to December 31, 2026.

### 6.3 Resources
