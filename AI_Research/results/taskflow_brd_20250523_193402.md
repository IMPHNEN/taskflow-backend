 TaskFlow

 1. Introduction
TaskFlow is a project management tool designed specifically for software developers. It leverages AI to generate tasks directly from Product Requirement Documents (PRDs), streamlining the development process and enhancing efficiency. The project aims to address the challenges faced by developers in managing complex projects and ensuring accurate task generation.

 2. Business Objectives
- Improve the efficiency of task management for software developers.
- Ensure accurate task generation from PRD documents using AI.
- Enhance project management capabilities by integrating AI-driven task generation.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for managing tasks and projects.

 3. Project Scope
 3.1 In Scope
- Development of AI algorithms for task generation from PRDs.
- Integration of AI capabilities into the project management tool.
- Design and development of a user-friendly interface.
- Testing and validation of the AI-driven task generation.
 3.2 Out of Scope
- Development of additional project management features unrelated to AI task generation.
- Integration with third-party tools beyond the scope of task generation.
- Extensive user training and support beyond initial implementation.
